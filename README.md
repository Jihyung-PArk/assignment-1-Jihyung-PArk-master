# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker
Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: **Jihyung Park**  


This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
(`temp.csv` is to copy from in case you delete the contents of `places.csv` and want the original data back).  
**Edit this README file**, replacing this paragraph with your own assignment name and details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the `answer...` parts).  
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code (over one week).

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?
> I started my CP1404 assignment on March 15th and finally completed it on March 29th. 90% of the project was completed in 5 days from March 23rd to March 27th, and error checks and bugs were fixed during the remaining period.

2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for assignment 2?
>In assignment 2, I want to use classes, GUI and use simpler logic to complete the overall simple coding. In this assignment, I will make up for the parts I feel lacking by myself, plan complex and not long coding, and make simple coding according to the plan.
